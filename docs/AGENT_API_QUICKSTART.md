# Agent API Quickstart

This quickstart connects Codex, Claude, or a CLI script to FoxDesk without
giving the assistant more access than the user who created the key.

## Steps

1. Sign in as the user whose permissions the assistant should inherit.
2. Open **Settings -> API & agents**.
3. Create a scoped key with a clear name, for example `Codex local assistant`.
4. Select only the scopes the assistant needs.
5. Copy the key once.

Use the same **API & agents** page for Codex, Claude, automations, and tracked AI
agents. The key inherits the permissions of the admin creating it and is further
limited by the scopes selected on the form.
6. Configure the local example env:

```bash
cp examples/agent-api/.env.example examples/agent-api/.env
```

7. Edit `examples/agent-api/.env` and paste the token.
8. Run a smoke command:

```bash
sh examples/agent-api/create-ticket.sh
```

## Important: API access, not browser login

When you receive `https://app.foxdesk.net` and an API token, do not open the web
app or `/index.php?page=login`. The token is not a password and it will not
create a browser session.

Treat the URL as the API host and call FoxDesk with an `Authorization: Bearer`
header:

```bash
FOXDESK_BASE_URL=https://app.foxdesk.net
FOXDESK_API_TOKEN=fdx_replace_with_token_from_settings

curl -fsS "$FOXDESK_BASE_URL/index.php?page=api&action=agent-docs" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $FOXDESK_API_TOKEN"
```

If a browser request redirects to login, switch back to the API endpoint. It
means the request was missing the bearer header or was sent to the web UI
instead of `/index.php?page=api&action=...`.

## Examples

Every agent session should start by loading live API documentation for the
current token:

```bash
curl -s "${FOXDESK_BASE_URL}/index.php?page=api&action=agent-docs" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${FOXDESK_API_TOKEN}"
```

The response lists the current token scopes, available actions, missing scopes,
request shapes, safety rules, and examples. This lets Codex, Claude, or an
automation decide what it can do before it reads or writes helpdesk data.

Create a ticket:

```bash
FOXDESK_TICKET_TITLE="Printer issue" \
FOXDESK_TICKET_DESCRIPTION="The office printer is offline." \
sh examples/agent-api/create-ticket.sh
```

Add time to an existing ticket:

```bash
FOXDESK_TICKET_ID=123 \
FOXDESK_DURATION_MINUTES=45 \
FOXDESK_TIME_SUMMARY="Diagnosed printer network settings." \
sh examples/agent-api/log-time.sh
```

Add one work record with a visible comment and linked time entry:

```bash
FOXDESK_TICKET_ID=123 \
FOXDESK_COMMENT="<p><strong>Network fix</strong></p><p>Updated DNS and verified access.</p>" \
FOXDESK_MANUAL_DATE=2026-05-25 \
FOXDESK_MANUAL_START_TIME=21:18 \
FOXDESK_MANUAL_END_TIME=22:06 \
FOXDESK_DURATION_MINUTES=48 \
sh examples/agent-api/comment-with-time.sh
```

Prepare a report review:

```bash
FOXDESK_ORGANIZATION_ID=1 \
FOXDESK_TIME_RANGE=this_month \
sh examples/agent-api/prepare-report.sh
```

## Agent Instructions

- Codex: `examples/agent-api/codex-instructions.md`
- Claude: `examples/agent-api/claude-instructions.md`
- MCP server: `docs/AGENT_MCP_SERVER.md`

Run the local MCP wrapper when your agent supports MCP:

```bash
npm run agent:mcp
```

## Required scopes

- Read live docs: valid token only, no specific scope
- Create ticket: `tickets:write`
- Add comment: `comments:write`
- Log time: `time:write`
- Add comment with linked time: `tickets:read`, `comments:write`, `time:write`
- Prepare report review: `reports:read`
- Upload attachment: `attachments:write`

Use read-only scopes first when testing. Add write scopes only after the agent's
workflow is clear.

401 means the key is missing or invalid. 403 means the key is valid but the user
or token scope cannot perform that action.
