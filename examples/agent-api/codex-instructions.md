# Codex Agent Instructions

Use this when connecting Codex to FoxDesk through a scoped API key.

## Local Secret

Create `examples/agent-api/.env` from `.env.example` and store:

```bash
FOXDESK_BASE_URL=https://app.foxdesk.net
FOXDESK_API_TOKEN=fdx_replace_with_token_from_settings
```

Never paste a production token into a shared prompt. Never print FOXDESK_API_TOKEN.
Prefer the local `.env` file or your secret manager.

## Start Every Session

Before choosing a FoxDesk action, load the live documentation for the current
token:

```bash
curl -s "$FOXDESK_BASE_URL/index.php?page=api&action=agent-docs" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $FOXDESK_API_TOKEN"
```

Use that response as the source of truth for allowed actions, required scopes,
request fields, and safety rules.

## Allowed Tools

Use only these scripts unless the user explicitly asks for a lower-level API
call:

```bash
sh examples/agent-api/create-ticket.sh
sh examples/agent-api/add-comment.sh
sh examples/agent-api/comment-with-time.sh
sh examples/agent-api/log-time.sh
sh examples/agent-api/prepare-report.sh
```

## Behavior

- Read the user's intent first, then set the relevant `FOXDESK_*` variables.
- Use `FOXDESK_TICKET_ID` or `FOXDESK_TICKET_HASH` before commenting or logging
  time.
- Prefer `comment-with-time.sh` when a work note and exact worked time belong to
  the same update; it creates one comment and links the time entry through
  `comment_id`.
- Treat 401/403 as permission or token-scope problems, not application bugs.
- For write actions, keep the default `Idempotency-Key` header or set
  `FOXDESK_IDEMPOTENCY_KEY` when retrying the same action.
- Summarize the created ticket id, logged minutes, or report totals back to the
  user.
